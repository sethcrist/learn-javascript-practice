// 13. Write a statement that takes a variable of trafficLight and logs "go" if the light is green, "slow down" if the light is yellow and "stop" if the light is red.
// 14. Write a statement that takes two variables that are numbers and outputs the larger number. If the numbers are equal, output "the numbers are the same".
